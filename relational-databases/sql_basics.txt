Query Syntax:
    The syntax of the select statement with a where clause:
    select columns from tables where condition (and / or / not) condition;
    (Columns are separated by commas; use * to select all columns.)

    ex.: select name form animals where (not species = 'gorilla') and (not name = 'Max');
         select name form animals where species != 'gorilla' and name != 'Max';   (just like python operator) 

    we can use this in exeptions:
        order by  (desc?)
        limit n offset n (could use for pagination)
        group by 
    
    The basic syntax for the insert statement:
    insert into table ( column1, column2, ... ) values ( val1, val2, ... );
